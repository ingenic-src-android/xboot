Sources directory
-----------------

  spl/		- contains the spl sources.
  boot/	  	- contains the loader sources that will be loaded by spl.
  Makefile	- top makefile
  config.mk/rules.mk - common makefile includes.
  mkconfig	- tool to create include/config.h
  x-boot.lds	- linker script

Build Steps
-----------
1. place the xboot folder under android/bootable/bootloader/

2. setup the android build environment by ". build/envsetup.sh" and lunch.

3. under xboot folder:
   1) make clean
   2) make urboard_nand_config
   3) make

NOTE: urboard.h for uart4 and urboard3.h for uart3. switch the file before compiling the target uart xboot.


Porting Guide
-------------

  If you want to add a new board called 'myboard' based on JZ4760,
  take following as reference.

  1. Add the board config to x-boot/Makefile.

     myboard_nand_config:	unconfig
	@echo "#define CONFIG_NAND_X_BOOT" > include/config.h
	@echo "Compile NAND boot image for myboard"
	@./mkconfig jz4760 myboard
	@echo "CONFIG_NAND_X_BOOT = y" > include/config.mk
	@echo "CONFIG_JZ4760 = y" >> include/config.mk

  2. Add the board definition to x-boot/include/configs/myboard.h.

  3. Add jz4760.h to x-boot/include/.

  4. Add JZ4760 nand spl padding support to x-boot/spl/tools/nand-spl-pad.sh.

  5. Add your cpu and board specific codes as necessary.
